This game is played on a grid that's 3 squares by 3 squares. Beauty about this
webpage is when you click on the heading "Tic Tac Toe" it gets enlarged.

## Rules for Mark or Sign :
-----------------------
There are 2 Players  - each given a chance to select Mark ( "O" or "X" ).<br>
In this 2 Players cannot take the same mark . This means If player 1 takes "O"
then Player 2 can take "X" only.<br>
If two players take same mark(sign), then the webpage will show a message
"2 Players cannot have the same sign ....." and will not allow player to play
until they change their mark.

## Rule to play the game :
----------------------
The first player to get 3 of her marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally)
is the winner. Then no more clicks on button works when one wins the game.<br>
Whichever button is clicked , it becomes disabled.<br>
When all 9 squares are full and no one wins the game then the game is draw.This
is shown by the message "Game Draw....."
